# CAST-128

## High-level summary
Feistel; 64-bit block; 40–128-bit keys; 12 or 16 rounds depending on key length. Often known as CAST5 (used historically in PGP).

## Why it matters for this project
- Provides examples of **architectures** (SPN vs Feistel vs ARX-like).
- Provides examples of **components** (S-box, permutations, linear diffusion, key schedules).
- Provides baseline expectations for evaluation (round counts, diffusion behavior, etc.).

## Notes
This is a brief catalog entry to support retrieval and comparisons in the RAG assistant.
