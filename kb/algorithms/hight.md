# HIGHT (HIGh security and light weigHT)

HIGHT is a lightweight block cipher standardized in ISO/IEC 18033-4, designed in South Korea for RFID and sensor network applications.

## Key Properties
- **Architecture:** Generalized Feistel with ARX-style F-function
- **Block size:** 64 bits | **Key size:** 128 bits | **Rounds:** 32
- **F-function:** Uses modular addition and rotations
- **Gate count:** ~3048 GE
- **Standard:** ISO/IEC 18033-4

## Relevance to LWC
HIGHT is a standardized LWC cipher that bridges Feistel and ARX paradigms. Its ISO standardization makes it a credible reference for IoT security research. It is particularly relevant for RFID tag implementations.
